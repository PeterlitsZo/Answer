\subsubsection{题目}
曼哈顿城正在施工！

城市里一共有n个施工点，施工点总是会发出莫名其妙的噪音，特别是当两个施工点距离足够远时还会发生神奇的反应，让噪音变得更大。

所以现在曼哈顿的区长请你来计算一下两两施工点之间曼哈顿距离的最大值是多少。

坐标为(𝑥1,𝑦1)(x1,y1)的施工点和坐标为(𝑥2,𝑦2)(x2,y2)的施工点曼哈顿距离为|𝑥2−𝑥1|+|𝑦2−𝑦1|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{输入}
第一行一个整数T表示数据组数
一行一个n
接下来n行，每行两个整数表示施工点的坐标。

其中 2≤n≤200,0≤x,y≤1000 数据不超过10组。

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{输出}
一行一个整数表示最大的曼哈顿距离。
