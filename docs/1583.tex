\subsubsection{题目}
食堂有n个窗口，每个窗口都有一个美味值ai，小C今天来到食堂吃饭，由于小C刚运动完很
累，不想端着盘子走很远，他会选择m个连续的窗口，获取这m个窗口的美味值。现在小C想
知道他最多能获得多少美味值。

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{输入}
第一行整数T，表示数据组数。

接来来共3T行：

第一行两个整数n和m。(1≤m≤n)
第二行n个整数表示每个窗口的美味值ai。

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{输出}
T行，每行表示小C可以获取的最大美味值。

\subsubsection{示例}
输入：
\begin{lstlisting}
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
\end{lstlisting}

输出：
\begin{lstlisting}
9
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{题解}
求一个数组中连续$m$个数的和的最大值

利用前缀和可以对连续$m$个数的和进行$O(1)$查询

$sum[x] = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{x}{a[i]}$，就是前缀和

易证：$\sum_{i = l}^{r}{a[i]} = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]$

可以先求出$sum$数组在循环一遍求连续$m$个数的最大值

时间复杂度：$O(n)$
