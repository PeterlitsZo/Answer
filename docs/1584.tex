\subsubsection{题目}
一个二叉树，如果每一个层的结点数都达到最大值，则这个二叉树就是满二叉树。对于深度为D的，有N个结点的二叉树，若其结点对应于相同深度满二叉树的层序遍历的前N个结点，这样的树就是完全二叉树。

给定一棵完全二叉树的后序遍历，请你给出这棵树的层序遍历结果。

定义：
后序遍历：在二叉树中，先左后右再根，即首先遍历左子树，然后遍历右子树，最后访问根结点。
层序遍历：对某一层的节点访问完后，再按照他们的访问次序对各个节点的左孩子和右孩子顺序访问。

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{输入}
第一行一个正整数T,表示接下来有T组测试样例；

接下来T组数据，每一组数据的第一行有一个整数N，即树中结点个数。每一组数据的第二行
给出后序遍历序列，为N个不超过100的正整数。同一行中所有数字都以空格分隔。

数据范围：1≤N≤30

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{输出}
在一行中输出该树的层序遍历序列。

\begin{lstlisting}
1
8  
91 71 2 34 10 15 55 18
\end{lstlisting}

输出：
\begin{lstlisting}
18 34 55 71 2 10 15 91
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{题解}
树的遍历方式等等知识大一下学数据结构会系统地学

对于一颗完全二叉树，你可以用一个数组来模拟他的编号，若当前节点的编号为$i$，则他的左节点(左儿子)的编号为$2 \times i$，他的右节点(右儿子)的编号为$2 \times i + 1$，这样编号会简化遍历的顺序，像题目中给的那个图一样

根据后序遍历的定义模拟它的做法(递归)：

1. 若左节点编号存在，先遍历左子树
2. 若右节点编号存在，再遍历右子树
3. 读入当前值

时间复杂度：$O(n)$
