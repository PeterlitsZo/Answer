\subsubsection{题目}
“啊！！！我的秀发”

众所周知，cgg有一头乌黑透亮的秀发。在期中复习前夕，cgg在自习室复习计网时又掉了一些头发，这让他十分伤心。巧合的是，cgg掉落下来的头发有规律的排成了′(‘和′)′组成的序列，也就是左右括号。cgg将这些头发视为珍宝。

dyyyyyyyy想捉弄一下cgg，他想拿走一些头发(数量可能为0)，使得头发序列不是合法括号序列。为了不被cgg发现，要使拿走的头发竟可能的少。你能帮助他完成这个任务吗？

合法括号序列：

空字符串是合法括号序列
如果s是合法括号序列，′(‘+s+‘)′也是合法括号序列
如果s和t是合法括号序列，那么s+t也是合法括号序列
例：(()())()，(())，()()，()是合法括号序列，())，)(，)不是合法括号序列

输入保证字符串中仅含有左括号′(‘和右括号′)′
你可以使其变为不合法括号序列吗？输出你要拿走头发的最小数量。

\subsubsection{输入}
第一行t，表示共有t组样例

每组输入两行，第一行为l，1≤l≤1000000，第二行为一个字符串，输入保证字符串中仅含有′(‘,′)′。

输入保证∑l≤1000000

\subsubsection{输出}
对于每组样例输出需要拿走头发的最小数量。

\subsubsection{示例}
输入：
\begin{lstlisting}
3
3
()(
2
()
1
(
\end{lstlisting}

输出：
\begin{lstlisting}
0
1
0

\subsection{题解}

对于一个括号序列，考虑一下两种情况

1. 是合法括号序列，那么通过一次改变必定可以使他变为不合法括号序列。删除第一个字符即可。输出1。
2. 不是合法括号序列，那么不需要进行删除操作。输出0。

时间复杂度：$O(n)$
